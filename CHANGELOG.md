# Changelog

All notable changes to `bb` are documented here. Dates are UTC. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-04-17

### New commands

- **`bb webhook`** — manage repository and workspace webhooks. Supports `list`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`; defaults to repo scope via git context, `--workspace-only` for workspace-level hooks. The `--event` flag is repeatable and accepts comma-separated values (`--event repo:push,pullrequest:created`).
- **`bb runner`** — manage self-hosted Bitbucket Pipelines runners. Supports `list`, `view`, `create`, `disable`, `enable`, `delete`. Defaults to workspace scope, `--repo` for repo-level runners. `create` prints the one-time OAuth client credentials Bitbucket returns; these are shown **only once** — store them before closing the terminal.
- **`bb project`** — manage Bitbucket workspace projects (the container that holds repositories). Supports `list`, `view`, `create`, `update`, `delete`.
- **`bb auth switch [account]`** — switch between multiple stored Bitbucket accounts without running `bb auth logout` + `bb auth login`. Running with no argument lists the stored accounts with the active one marked.

### Enhancements

- **OAuth scope update** — the consent flow now requests `project:write`, `webhook`, `runner`, and `runner:write` in addition to the existing scopes. **After upgrading, run `bb auth login` once to pick up the new scopes** — tokens issued by earlier versions will return 403 on the new commands.
- **Account- and scope-aware error hint** — on a 403/404 response, `bb` now prints a targeted suggestion:
  - Multiple accounts stored → "Hint: you are signed in as `X`. If another account has access, try: `bb auth switch <other>`".
  - Single account + 403 → "Hint: this token may be missing a required scope. Run: `bb auth login`".
- **Typed HTTP errors** — `pkg/api` now returns `*api.HTTPError{StatusCode, Message}` from non-2xx responses, so commands and future tooling can branch on status code without string matching.

### Upgrade notes

Run `bb auth login` after upgrading so your token carries the new scopes. If you maintain multiple Bitbucket accounts, `bb auth status` will list both and you can flip between them with `bb auth switch <account>`.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-09

### New commands

- **`bb pr edit`** — edit a PR's title, description, base branch, or reviewers after it has been created. Accepts `--title`, `--body`, `--base`, and `--add-reviewer` flags; runs an interactive form when no flags are given.
- **`bb branch tidy`** — cross-references local branches against Bitbucket PRs and deletes the ones whose PRs are merged or declined. Supports `--dry-run` and `--force`.
- **`bb status`** — personal cross-repo dashboard. Shows your open PRs (with approval counts) and PRs awaiting your review, across all repos in the workspace.
- **`bb api`** — raw authenticated API proxy. Sends any request to the Bitbucket REST API with auth, placeholder substitution (`{workspace}`, `{repo}`), `--paginate`, `--jq` filtering, and nested `-f key=value` body fields.
- **`bb batch`** — runs any `bb` command across all (or glob-filtered) repos in a workspace, with configurable concurrency.
- **`bb extension`** (`bb ext`) — install, list, and remove CLI plugins from git repositories. Installed extensions become top-level `bb` subcommands.

### Enhancements

- **Smart PR descriptions** — `bb pr create` now auto-generates the PR body from `git log`, a `.bitbucket/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` template if present, and appends a `Related:` link when the branch name contains a Jira key (e.g. `feat/PROJ-123-my-feature`).
- **Interactive picker** — PR and branch commands (`view`, `merge`, `approve`, `decline`, `checkout`, `comment`, `diff`, `browse`, `edit`, `delete`, `rename`) now show a filterable interactive list when the number/name argument is omitted. Type to filter, Enter to select.
- **Dynamic shell completions** — Tab-completing PR numbers, branch names, and repo slugs now queries the Bitbucket API in real time. Completions include a description column (PR title, repo description).
- **Pipeline desktop notifications** — `bb pipeline watch --notify` fires a native OS notification (macOS `osascript`, Linux `notify-send`, Windows PowerShell) when the pipeline completes, so you can switch to other work while it runs.

### Bug fixes

- `bb branch tidy`: fixed a critical bug where `ListPRsForBranch` only returned OPEN PRs regardless of the requested state. The Bitbucket API requires state as a dedicated query parameter; passing it via the `q` filter has no effect. The command now correctly fetches MERGED and DECLINED PRs.
- `bb api`: HTTP method is now uppercased before the request is sent. Lowercase methods (e.g. `-X get`) were silently rejected by some servers.
- `bb api`: `--input -` now reads from stdin. Previously it tried to open a literal file named `-`.
- `bb api`: 4xx responses no longer print the error twice (once from the command, once from the Execute handler).
- `bb extension remove`: added path-traversal guard on the extension name argument; now returns a clear error for non-installed extensions instead of silently succeeding.
- `bb extension install`: fixed binary discovery fallback — the secondary path was computing the same filename as the primary path, making it a no-op.
- `bb status`: added a goroutine semaphore (concurrency 5) to avoid firing one API request per repo simultaneously and hitting the Bitbucket rate limit.
- `bb status`: summary stats now go to stdout, not stderr.
- `bb pr create`: Jira `Related:` link no longer starts the PR description with `\n\nRelated:` when the body is empty.
- `pkg/notify`: Windows PowerShell notification now escapes single quotes in the title and message to prevent script injection.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-14

### Bug fixes

- `bb repo clone`: OAuth token is now injected into the HTTPS clone URL to avoid interactive password prompts.
- Security audit fixes: command injection via `$EDITOR`, git branch flag injection, dangerous clone URL schemes, and temp file path traversal.
- `bb pipeline watch`, `bb pipeline list`: `--limit 0` now fetches all results (documented as 0 = all).
- Install script: auto-elevates with `sudo` when the target directory requires it; extracts all tar contents correctly.
